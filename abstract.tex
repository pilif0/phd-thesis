We present a formal framework for process composition based on actions that are specified by their input and output resources.
The correctness of these compositions is verified by translating them into deductions in intuitionistic linear logic.
As part of the verification we derive simple conditions on the compositions which ensure well-formedness of the corresponding deduction when satisfied.
By connecting the compositions to port graphs, we also verify an alternate characterisation of their correctness in terms of resource dependence between individual actions.
We close our theoretical development on an exploration of a probabilistic refinement of non-determinism in our framework.

We mechanise the whole framework, including a deep embedding of ILL and a theory of port graphs, in the proof assistant Isabelle/HOL\@.
Beyond the increased confidence in our proofs, this allows us to automatically generate executable code for our verified definitions.
