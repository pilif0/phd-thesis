# ELK definitions

This directory contains a number of port graphs encoded in ELK JSON, generated by the Isabelle theory, which were used to produce the port graph figures with the [ELK Demonstrator](https://rtsys.informatik.uni-kiel.de/elklive/json.html).
Note that, for the sake of readability, some of the captured visualisations were edited (e.g. to add labels).
